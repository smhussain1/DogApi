<!--Create an app that lets users choose to display between 1 and 50 random dog images, 
    then prints the results to the console. The app should feature a form with a required 
    input where users indicate the number of images to retrieve, and the input should default to 3. 
    Use the endpoint described in the "DISPLAY MULTIPLE RANDOM IMAGES FROM ALL DOGS COLLECTION" 
    section of this page of the DogAPI docs.-->
    <!--Create a form with user instruction and entry field and Submit button
    Add JQuery listener, capture the number and feed it into an API Get Request,
    Call the service and return the image and present it.  The user entered number will also have to
    create as many divs to contain each image returned.  Finally, the entry field will have to return
    to its initial state.-->
